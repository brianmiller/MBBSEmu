# MBBSEmu Reference Documents

All reference documents used in the creation of MBBSEmu have been moved to their own repository. 

Over the years while developing MBBSEmu, our documents repository has grown very large in size and was becoming cumbersome for people cloning the repo. Because of this, we decided to split them out into their own repository.

You may access them here: [reference-documents](https://github.com/mbbsemu/reference-documents)
